Feature: Chart test takes longer time and exceeds default timeout
  Partners, redhat or community user submit charts which result in errors

  Scenario Outline: [HC-16-001] A partner or community user submits chart that takes more than 30 mins
    Given the vendor "<vendor>" has a valid identity as "<vendor_type>"
    And an error-free chart tarball is used in "<chart_path>"
    When the user sends a pull request with the chart
    Then the pull request is not merged
    And user gets the "<message>" in the pull request comment

        When the user sends a pull request with the chart
        Then the user sees the pull request is merged
        And the index.yaml file is updated with an entry for the submitted chart
        And a release is published with corresponding report and chart tarball

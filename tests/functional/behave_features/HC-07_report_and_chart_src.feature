Feature: Chart source submission with report
    Partners, redhat and community users can publish their chart by submitting
    error-free chart in source format with a report.

    Scenario Outline: [HC-07-001] A partner or redhat associate submits an error-free chart source with report
        Given the vendor "<vendor>" has a valid identity as "<vendor_type>"
        And an error-free chart source used in "<chart_path>" and report in "<report_path>"
        When the user sends a pull request with the chart and report
        Then the user sees the pull request is merged
        And the index.yaml file is updated with an entry for the submitted chart
        And a release is published with corresponding report and chart tarball

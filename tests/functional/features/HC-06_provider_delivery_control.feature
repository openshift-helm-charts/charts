  Scenario Outline: [HC-06-001] A partner associate submits an error-free report with provider controlled delivery
    Given the vendor <vendor> has a valid identity as <vendor_type>
    And provider delivery control is set to <provider_control_owners> in the OWNERS file
    And a <report_path> is provided
    And provider delivery control is set to <provider_control_report> in the report

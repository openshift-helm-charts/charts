      | tests/data/vault-0.17.0.tgz    | PR includes one or more files not related to charts |

  Scenario Outline: A user submits a chart with non chart related file
    Given the vendor <vendor> has a valid identity as <vendor_type>
    And chart source is used in <chart_path>
    And user adds a non chart related file
    When the user sends a pull request with both chart and non related file
    Then the pull request is not merged

"""Check submitted charts

New Openshift or chart-verifier will trigger (automatically or manually) a recursive checking on
existing submitted charts under `charts/` directory with the specified Openshift and chart-verifier
version.

Besides, during workflow development, engineers would like to check if the changes will break checks
on existing submitted charts.

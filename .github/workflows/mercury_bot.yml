# Checks OWNERS file additions and modifications submitted by mercury-bot on a
# partner's behalf, typically in response to a partner updating their project
# metadata.
#
# Automatically approves modifications mercury-bot makes. Sanity checks
# net-new OWNERS files to ensure their addition does not conflict with
# existing locks.

            ### Submission Facts Mismatch

            The content of the OWNERS file and your submission path do not seem to match. Double check that
            your vendor label and chart name values in your OWNERS file match with your submission path.

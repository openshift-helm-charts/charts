name: Check Chart Lock Status

# Checks Red Hat and Community OWNERS file additions against our chart lockfile.
# 
# Red Hat and Community OWNERS files are not auto-merged, and require maintainer
# review and action. This is intended to automate checking lock files.
#
# Technically maintainers should re-run this workflow just before merging. This is
# noted in the comment sent to the PR.
#
# This does not fail even if a chart is locked. A modification to an existing chart
# lock is considered valid, and therefore maintainers will use their discretion
# to merge modifications.

            ### Submission Facts Mismatch

            The content of the OWNERS file and your submission path do not seem to match. Double check that
            your vendor label and chart name values in your OWNERS file match with your submission path.

            The OWNERS file contributed here has a chart name that is **AVAILABLE**!

            The chart name '${{ steps.gather-metadata.outputs.chart-name }}' does not appear in our lockfile.

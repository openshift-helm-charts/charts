name: Check Contributor

# Checks that the input user exists in the approvers section
# of a given OWNERS file.
#
# Returns true/false at the is-repo-owner output.
#
# Can be configured to fail altogether for contexts where it makes sense,
# but in cases where this needs to return a green check mark, it is the
# the caller's responsibility to evaluate the is-repo-owner output to inform
# whether to proceed with subsequent tasks.
#
# Intended for use with workflows triggered by pull_request_target (or similar)
# events.

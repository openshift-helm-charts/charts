name: Check For Lock
description: |
  Checks for the existence of chart-name in a given chart lock file. If a chart
  is found to be locked at the URL searched, the lockpath is returned should the
  caller need it for further evaluation.

  Designed to work with OWNERS file merges to prevent chart naming conflicts.
inputs:
  # e.g. vault
  chart-name:
    required: true
    description:
      Check the lock status of this chart by name.
  fail-workflow-if-locked:
    required: false
    default: 'false'
    description: |
      Forces a failure of this action when the chart is locked. Must explicitly
      be set to the value 'true'. All other values (even a boolean true) are
      considered false.
outputs:
  # e.g. true/false
  chart-is-locked:
    description: Whether the chart provided via the chart-name input is locked
    value: ${{ steps.set-lock-state.outputs.chart-is-locked }}
  # e.g. charts/category/vendor/chartname if package-is-locked is true, else null

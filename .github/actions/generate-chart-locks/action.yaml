name: Generate Chart Locks
description: |
  Generates chart locks at runtime and places the generated contents on the
  filesystem.

  For pull_request / pull_request_target events, this will pull down the branch
  receiving the changes as the source of truth.

  In the production repository, this will always pull the main branch, regardless
  of which branch is receiving the pull request.

  It is expected that the CI scripts have already been installed at call time.

  generator-cmd-path:
    description: |
      The path to the generate-chart-locks command. This action expects CI
      scripts to be installed by the caller, and so it stands to reason the
      caller may install scripts at various locations.

outputs:
  lockfile-path:
    description: |
      Where the lock file was written. Mostly placed as an output to simplify
      workflows for callers.

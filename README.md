# OpenShift Helm Charts

OpenShift Helm Charts is a repository hosting [Helm Charts](https://github.com/helm/helm) available out-of-the-box with [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/). It contains popular technologies, tools and services. Helm Charts on this repository can be provided by the community, by partners or Red Hat. 

Charts go through an automated Red Hat OpenShift certification workflow, which guarantees security compliance as well as best integration and experience with the platform.

```

Where entity is the name of the company, chart-name a unique name for the chart in this repo, and version the current version of the chart. The chart can also be packaged using the following command:

```bash
$ helm package ./<chart-name>
```

Package can then be placed directly under `./charts/partners/<entity>/<chart-name>/<version>` for example: `./charts/partners/redhat/my-awsome-chart/0.1.2/my-awsome-chart-0.1.2.tgz`.

## OpenShift Certification Program

The certification program is a great opportunity to not only double check the integrity of the charts but also use some additional testing resources. Static verification logic will run first and then actual chart testing can be run against real OpenShift clusters. If partners prefer to run the test on their own clusters, the certification program allows for that via a test report submission.

# .NET Helm Chart
A Helm chart for building and deploying a [.NET](https://dot.net/) application on OpenShift.

## Prerequisites
Below are prerequisites that may apply to your use case.

### Pull Secret
You will need to create a pull secret if you pull an S2I builder from an external registry. Use the following command as a reference to create your pull secret:
```bash
oc create secret docker-registry my-pull-secret --docker-server=$SERVER_URL --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL
```

You can use this secret by passing `--set build.pullSecret=my-pull-secret` to `helm install`, or you can configure this in a values file:
```yaml
build:
  pullSecret: my-pull-secret
```
and apply by passing `--values $VALUES_FILE`.

### Push Secret
You will need to create a push secret if you want to push your image to an external registry. Use the following command as a reference to create your push secret:
```bash
oc create secret docker-registry my-push-secret --docker-server=$SERVER_URL --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL
```

You can use this secret by passing `--set build.output.pushSecret=my-push-secret` and `--set build.output.kind=DockerImage` to `helm install`, or you can configure these in a values file:
```yaml
build:
  output:
    kind: DockerImage
    pushSecret: my-push-secret
```

## Values
Below is a table of each value used to configure this chart.

You must change the `build.uri`, `build.ref` and `build.startupProject` to refer to your own application.
`build.imageStreamTag.name` must be set to match the .NET version used by your application.


| Value | Description | Default | Additional Information |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `image.name` | Name of the image you want to build/deploy | Defaults to the Helm release name. | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStream](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html) based on this value. |
| `image.tag` | Tag that you want to build/deploy | `latest` | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStreamTag](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html#images-using-imagestream-tags_image-streams-managing) based on the name provided |
| `build.enabled` | Determines if build-related resources should be created. | `true` | Set this to `false` if you want to deploy a previously built image. Leave this set to `true` if you want to build and deploy a new image. |
| `build.uri` | Git URI that references your git repo | https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-ex | This value defaults to a sample application. Be sure to override this if you want to build and deploy your own application. |
| `build.ref` | Git ref containing the application you want to build | dotnet-8.0 | This value defaults to the sample application branch. Be sure to override this if you want to build and deploy your own application. |
| `build.startupProject` | Path to the project to run. This can refer to a project file (e.g. csproj), or a directory containing a single project. | `app` | This value defaults to the sample application project. Be sure to override this if you want to build and deploy your own application. |
| `build.contextDir` | The sub-directory where the application source code exists | - | - |
| `build.imageStreamTag.name` | The ImageStreamTag name of the desired builder image | `dotnet:8.0` | This value defaults to the .NET version of the sample application. Be sure to use the tag that matches the version of .NET your application targets. |
| `build.imageStreamTag.useReleaseNamespace` | Determines if the builder ImageStreamTag referenced by `build.imageStreamTag.name` is in the same namespace you are installing this Helm chart to | `false` | - |
| `build.imageStreamTag.namespace` | When useReleaseNamespace is `false`, determines the namespace containing the builder ImageStreamTag. | `openshift` | - |

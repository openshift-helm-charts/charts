                              that should be replaced. When a new string is produced
                              during the substitution operation, the new string is
                              initially the same as the subject string, but then all
                              matches in the subject string are replaced by the substitution
                              string. If replacing all matches isn't desired, regular
                              expression anchors can be used to ensure a single match,
                              so as to replace just one occurrence of a pattern. Capture
                              groups can be used in the pattern to extract portions
                              of the subject string, and then referenced in the substitution
                              string.

                                                XML, this should be set to true. XSLT

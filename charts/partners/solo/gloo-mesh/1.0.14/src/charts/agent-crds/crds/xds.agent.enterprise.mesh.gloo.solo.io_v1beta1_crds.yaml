            XdsConfigs are used to issue xDS Configuration Resources to running Envoy instances.
               They are created by Gloo Mesh for processing by an agent running on managed clusters.

               The agent will serve the specified xDS configuration resources on its grpc-xds port (default 9977)
               to the Envoy instances (nodes) defined in the XDSConfigSpec.

               This feature is currently only available in Gloo Mesh Enterprise.

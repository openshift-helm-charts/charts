            Chart for deploying ibmcloud object storage plugin.
            IBM Cloud Object Storage is persistent, highly available storage
            that you can mount to apps that run in a Kubernetes cluster by using
            the IBM Cloud Object Storage plug-in. The plug-in is a Kubernetes Flex-Volume plug-in
            that connects Cloud Object Storage buckets to pods in your cluster.
